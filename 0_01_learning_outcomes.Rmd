## Statistical Concepts (I)

-   Given a description of some data, classify variables as numeric vs categorical, ratio vs. interval, and ordinal vs. nominal.

-   Construct simple summaries of numeric variables in R using the `mean`, `sd`, `var` functions.

-   Explain what sampling error is (in non-technical terms) and understand why it is necessary to quantify sampling error alongside point estimates.

-   Recognise the difference between the distribution of a sample, and the sampling distribution of an estimate derived from that sample.

-   Recognise the difference between the standard deviation (a property of a sample) and the standard error (a property of a sampling distribution).

-   Calculate the standard error of a sample mean when the population distribution of a variable follows a normal distribution.

-   Given a description of an experimental setting, be able to recognise...

    1. ...the difference between a statistical population and a sample from the population.
    2. ...the difference between a population parameter and a point estimate of the population parameter.

You are not expected to be able to explain or use the bootstrap or permutation tests---these were introduced to help you learn the principles listed above.
