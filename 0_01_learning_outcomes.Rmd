# Expected learning outcomes

## Statistical Concepts (I)

-   Given a description of some data, classify variables as numeric vs categorical, ratio vs. interval, and ordinal vs. nominal.

-   Construct simple summaries of numeric variables in R using the `mean`, `sd`, `var` functions.

-   Explain what sampling error is (in non-technical terms) and understand why it is necessary to quantify sampling error alongside point estimates.

-   Recognise the difference between the distribution of a sample, and the sampling distribution of an estimate derived from that sample.

-   Recognise the difference between the standard deviation (a property of a sample) and the standard error (a property of a sampling distribution).

-   Given a description of an experimental setting, recognise...

    1. ...the difference between a statistical population and a sample from the population.
    2. ...the difference between a population parameter and a point estimate of the population parameter.

## Statistical Concepts (II)

-   Understand what is meant by the term 'null hypothesis' and, given a scenario, state the appropriate null hypothesis for the associated statistical test.

-   Identify whether or not a result is 'statistically significance' by examining the *p*-value it produces. 

-   Calculate the standard error of a sample mean when the population distribution of a variable follows a normal distribution.

_You are not expected to be able to explain or use the the bootstrap or permutation test---this were introduced to help you learn the principles listed above._

## Simple parametric statistics (*t*-tests)

-   Understand that a one-sample *t*-test is used to assess whether a population mean is different from a particular reference value (often 0).

-   Understand that a two-sample *t*-test is used to assess whether two population means are different from one another. 

-   Understand that a paired-sample *t*-test is used to assess whether the mean difference among paired cases is different from reference value (usually 0). 

-   Given an experimental scenario and question, choose the correct *t*-test to use to answer the question.

-   State the assumptions of the one-sample, two-sample, and paired-sample *t*-tests, and explain how you might check them for a given problem using R.

-   Carry out a one-sample, two-sample or paired-sample *t*-test using the `t.test` function, and be able to interpret the output produced by `t.test`.

-   Write an informative and concise summary of the results from a one-sample, two-sample, or paired-sample *t*-test.

## Categorical Data (chi-square tests)

-   Recognise situations where you are studying one or more categorical variables and you need to compare the frequencies of each category (or combinations of categories) in some way.

-   Given an experimental scenario and question...

    1. ...decide on the appropriate type of analysis to use: goodness-of-fit, or contingency table.
    2. ...state the null hypothesis of the required test.
    
-   State the assumptions of the goodness-of-fit and contingency table tests.

-   Carry out a goodness-of-fit test using the `chisq.test` function.

-   Use the `xtabs` function to convert a set of counts of different combinations of categories to a table of cross-tabulated counts (when necessary). 

-   Carry out a contingency table test of association using the `chisq.test` function.

-   Write an informative and concise summary of the results from goodness-of-fit and contingency table tests.

## Associations and Relationships (regression)

-   Understand what simple linear regression analysis does, and when to use it.

-   State the assumptions of the simple linear regression model.

-   Fit a simple linear regression using the `lm` function and interpret the output from...

    1. ...`anova` to determine the significance of fit
    2. ...`summary` to extract the variance explained ($R^{2}$) and the fitted coefficients (intercept and slope) 
    
-   Use the `plot` function with a fitted model object to...

    1. ...construct a residuals vs. fitted values plot and evaluate the linearity assumption.
    2. ...construct a normal probability plot and evaluate the normality assumption.
    3. ...construct a scale-location plot and evaluate the constant variance assumption.

(You are **not** expected to be able to produce these plots manually using functions like `resid` and `fitted`)

-   Calculate predicted $y$-values from a fitted regression.

-   Write an informative and concise summary of the results from a simple linear regression analysis.

Your ability to summarise a regression analysis graphically---showing the data and the fitted line---will not be assessed.

## Associations and Relationships (correlation)

-   Distinguish between situations in which correlation or regression is the most appropriate technique to use.

-   State the assumptions of parametric (Pearson) and nonparametric (Spearman rank) correlation techniques and determine which approach is most approapriate for a given scenario.

-   Carry out the two types of correlation (Pearson and Spearman rank) using the `cor.test` function and interpret the results.

-   Write an informative and concise summary of the results from a correlation analysis.

## Experimental Design and ANOVA (I)

-   Understand what one-way ANOVA does and when to use it.

-   State the assumptions of one-way ANOVA model.

-   Fit a one-way ANOVA using the `lm` function and interpret the global test of significance produced by the `anova` function.

-   Use the `plot` function with a fitted model object to...

    1. ...construct a normal probability plot and evaluate the normality assumption.
    2. ...construct a scale-location plot and evaluate the constant variance assumption.

-   Determine whether it is appropriate to carry out a multiple comparison test.

-   Where appropriate, carry out a Tukey multiple comparison test using the `TukeyHSD` or `HSD.test` functions and interpret the results.

-   Write an informative and concise summary of the results from a one-way ANOVA analysis.

Your ability to summarise a one-way ANOVA graphically---showing the means and standard errrors---will not be assessed.

## Experimental Design and ANOVA (II)

-   Understand what two-way ANOVA does and when to use it.

-   Understand what is meant by the terms 'main effect' and 'interaction' and evaluate the likley presence or absence of these effects using an interaction plot.

-   State the assumptions of two-way ANOVA model.

-   Fit a two-way ANOVA using the `lm` function and interpret the three global tests of significance produced by the `anova` function.

-   Use the `plot` function with a fitted model object to...

    1. ...construct a normal probability plot and evaluate the normality assumption.
    2. ...construct a scale-location plot and evaluate the constant variance assumption.

-   Identify the main effect and interaction terms for which it is appropriate to carry out a multiple comparisons test.

-   Where appropriate, carry out Tukey multiple comparison test(s) using the `TukeyHSD` or `HSD.test` functions, and interpret the results.

-   Write an informative and concise summary of the results from a two-way ANOVA analysis.

Your ability to summarise a two-way ANOVA graphically---showing the means and standard errrors---will not be assessed.

## Fixing Problems

-   Use regression diagnostic plots to identify potential problems with the assumptions of a model.

-   When a problem with the assumptions of a model has been identified, choose an appropriate mathematical transformation to remedy the problem from...

    1. logarithm (including the "add 1" case when zeros are present)
    2. square root
    3. arcsine square root
    
-   Identify situations where transforming a variable fails, so that a non-parametric test is required.

-   Recognise that the Wilcoxon signed-rank test

    1. ...is an alternative to one-sample and paired-sample t-test
    2. ...is carried out by the wilcox.test function in R
    
-   Recognise that the Mann-Whitney U-test

    1. ...is an alternative to two-sample t-test
    2. ...is carried out by the wilcox.test (note the name!) function in R

-   Recognise that the Kruskal-Wallis test

    1. ...is an alternative to one-way ANOVA
    2. ...is carried out by the kruskal.test function in R
