# Working with frequencies

## Introduction

Much of the time in biology we are dealing with whole objects (plants, animals, cells, eggs, islands, etc.) or discrete events (attacks, matings, nesting attempts, etc.). We are often interested in making measurements of numeric variables (length, weight, number, etc.) and then either comparing means from samples (e.g. mean leaf size of plants from two habitat types), or investigating the association between different measurements (e.g. mean leaf size and herbivore damage).

However, we sometimes find a situation in which the ‘measurement’ we are interested in is not a quantitative measure (i.e. is not on a ratio or interval, scale), but is *categorical*. You will recall that categorical data are things like sex, colour or species. Such variables cannot be treated in the same way as numeric variables because although we can ‘measure’ each object (e.g. record if an animal is male or female), obviously we can’t calculate numeric quantities such as the ‘mean colour morph’, ‘mean species’ or ‘median sex’ of animals in a sample.

## A new kind of distribution

There are a quite a few of options for dealing with categorical data^[e.g. the 'log-linear model', 'Fisher's exact test', and the 'G-test'.]. We're just going to look at one option in this book: $\chi^2$ tests. This is pronounced, and sometimes written, 'chi-square'.^[The 'ch' is a hard 'ch', as in 'character'.]. This isn't necessarily the best approach for every problem, but $\chi^2$ tests are widely used in biology so they are a good place to start.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data.frame(Chi_2 = rchisq(5e5, df = 1)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Chi_2)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.4) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 10))
```

## Types of test

Although the tests all work on the same general principle, and all use the same statistic, it is helpful to distinguish two sorts of $\chi^2$ tests:

1.  $\chi^{2}$ **goodness of fit test**. A goodness-of-fit test is applicable in a situation where we have a single categorical variable (with any number of categories in it) and some hypothesis from which we can predict the expected proportions of observations falling in each category. For example, we might be interested in whether the number of males is equal to the number of females among second year students doing biology at Sheffield. We could record the numbers of males and females in a cohort, and use of the $\chi^{2}$ to assess whether the numbers we get deviate significantly from our expectation that about half the students will be female and half male if there is no sex-bias in students' decision to study biology at university.

2.  $\chi^{2}$ **contingency table test**. A contingency table test is applicable in a situation where each object is classified according to more than one categorical variable. Contingency table tests are usually used to test whether there is an association (or conversely, independence) between the variables. 

It's important to realise that in terms of the assumptions they rely on, contingency table and goodness-of-fit tests arn't fundamentally different from one another. The difference between the two types lies in the number of sets of variables used to classify the data, and in the type of hypothesis tested by each. The only real difference is that the when we carry out a goodness-of-fit test we have to supply the expected values, whereas the calculation of expected values is embedded in the formula used to carry out a contingency table test.

### The assumptions and requirements of $\chi^{2}$ tests

$\chi^{2}$ tests are often characterised as a type non-parametric tests---they do not assume any particular form for the distribution of the data. Consequently there are few assumptions to worry about.

*   Data are independent counts of objects or events which can be classified into mutually exclusive categories. 

*   Expected counts are not very low. The general rule of thumb is that the __expected values__ should be greater than 5.

(We'll explain what we mean by 'expected values' in a moment)

The most important thing to remember about $\chi^{2}$ tests is that they must always be carried out on the actual counts. Although the $\chi^{2}$ is really telling us how the proportions of objects in categories vary, the analysis should never be carried out on the percentages or proportions, only on the original count data. Similarly, $\chi^{2}$ cannot be used with means.
