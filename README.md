This is the course book for the Data Analysis in R course in the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences at the University of Sheffield. It is written using R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).

### Notes for the author

*   Do not place files in any directory ending in "_files". This will get moved into "_bookdown_files" and will not be tracked by git.

### To do list

*   Ask students to build their own data frames containing the data in the t-test exercises.

*   Throw in a large sample t-test that is a little non-normal

*   Chi-square GOF chapter needs a reminder that if the counts are in a data frame they need to be extracted with `$`

*   The chi-square exercises are too short...

*   Throw in a t-test in the chi-square exercises to remind people to _think_ about what they are being asked to do.

*   Ask students to evaluate where the warning is coming from in the eye colour / sex exercise, i.e. work out the expected values
