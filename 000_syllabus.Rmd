## Statistical Principles

-   Recognise the difference between a statistical population, a population parameter, a sample from the population, and a point estimate of the parameter.

-   Explain what sampling error is (in non-technical terms), and understand why it is necessary to quantify this alongside a point estimate.

-   Recognise the difference between the distribution of a sample, and the sampling distribution of an estimate derived from that sample.

-   Recognise the difference between the standard deviation (a property of a sample) and the standard error (a property of a sampling distribution).

-   Calculate the standard error of a sample mean when the population distribution of a variable follows a normal distribution.

-   Understand what is meant by the term 'null hypothesis' and be able to state the null hypothesis for standard statistical tests.

-   Identify whether or not a result is 'statistically significance' by examining the *p*-value it produces. 

You are not expected to be able to explain or use the bootstrap or permutation tests---these were introduced to help you learn the principles listed above.

## Simple parametric statistics

-   Understand that a one-sample *t*-test is used to assess whether a population mean is different from a particular reference value (often 0).

-   Understand that a two-sample *t*-test is used to assess whether two population means are different from one another. 

-   Understand that a paired-sample *t*-test is used to assess whether the mean difference among paired cases is different from reference value (usually 0). 

-   Given an experimental scenario and question, choose the correct *t*-test to use to answer the question.

-   List the assumptions of the one-sample, two-sample, and paired-sample *t*-tests, and explain how you might check them for a given problem, using R.

-   Carry out a one-sample, two-sample or paired-sample *t*-test using the `t.test` function in R, and be able to interpret the output produced by `t.test`.

-   Write an informative and concise summary of the results from a one-sample, two-sample, or paired-sample *t*-test.
