# Syllabus and assessment

## Principles (I)

* Recognise the correct definition of a statistical population, a population parameter, a sample, and a point estimate (also called a statistic).

* Explain what sampling error is (in non-technical terms), and explain why it is important to quantify this.

* Recognise the difference between the distribution of a sample, and the sampling distribution of an estimate (or statistic) derived from that sample.

* Explain, in non-technical terms, the difference between the standard deviation (a propery of a sample) and the standard error (a property of a sampling distribution).

* Calculate the standard error of a sample mean when the population distribution of the focal variable follows a normal distribution.

You are **not** expected to be able to explain or use the bootstrap.
