## Miscellaneous

The good news is that regression is generally quite a robust technique---i.e. it gives us reasonable answers even where the assumptions are not perfectly fulfilled. Be aware of the assumptions, but don’t get too worried by them–--if the violations are modest, proceed, but interpret your results with care.
