**The asterisks convention**

It is common to see ranges of probabilities coded with asterisks: 

`*`   for *p* = 0.05...0.01, 

`**`  for *p* = 0.01...0.001,

`***` for *p* < 0.001. 

This is common in tables and text in figures as it is a more compact and visually obvious representation than numbers. However, you should never use the asterisks convention in the text of a report.
